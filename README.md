# 🎓 Swiftech

**Swiftech** is a mobile-first **teacher evaluation system** built with **Jetpack Compose Material 3
**, using **Room Database** and **MVVM architecture**. It enables students to evaluate their
instructors per course with a clean, Google Form–like UI. The system is currently offline-first and
admin-controlled—designed for a future cloud-enabled version.
